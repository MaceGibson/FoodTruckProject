# Food Truck Project

## Description
The Food Truck Project is a Java console application that allows users to input and rate a list of food trucks. Users can then view the average rating and the highest-rated truck. The program uses a `FoodTruck` class to represent individual trucks and a `FoodTruckApp` class with the main method in order to run the application.

## Technologies Used
- Constructors
- Eclipse IDE shortcuts
- Getters
- Private/Public
- Static/Non-Static
- Encapsulation

## Lessons Learned
1. **Object-Oriented Programming:** The project reinforced concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) through the creation of a `FoodTruck` class with encapsulated fields and methods.

2. **Static Fields and Methods:** Understanding the use of static fields and methods, such as `nextTruckId` in the `FoodTruck` class, for maintaining state across instances of a class.

3. **User Input Handling:** Dealing with user input in a console application, including input validation and error handling.

4. **Array Manipulation:** Working with arrays to store and manipulate a collection of `FoodTruck` objects.

5. **Menu-Based User Interface:** Implementing a menu-driven user interface to provide users with options and control flow in the program.
